Hey everyone! My name is Adérito Xavier ([@pars3c](https://github.com/pars3c)), I am a Full Stack Developer, and a Data Scientist on my freetime.

My passion for programming started when I was 18 years old, when I read '2001 A Space Odyssey' for the the first time. It captivated me to think about the future and evolution.

Since then I never stopped fighting for that passion. Right now my main focus is on becoming Data Scientist, making Python my primary tool.
